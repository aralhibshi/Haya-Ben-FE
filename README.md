## Getting Started

Haya-ben is a single-page web application that specializes in personalized, packed meal boxes. To get started follow this **link** and go ahead and sign up from the top navigation bar.

### **Authentication**

Once your account has been made you will be directed to the sign in page. You can go ahead and set up your address for your order's delivery location.

### **Make your own Bento**

Customizing the bento is the main feature of this app. You can find it by navigating to the menu at the top navigation bar and selecting custom bento from the menu.

Typically a bento is made with 4 parts carbohydrates 3 parts protein 2 parts vegetable and 1 part pickles or fruit. The custom bento was designed around that concept. Just add your choice of carb, protein, vegetable or salad, and fruit and place the order.

### **Admin Panel**

Haya-ben comes with an admin panel which is a separate front-end application designed for the use of the kitchen owners. It is connected to the same database and serves as the main tool for the authorized party to modify elements of the webpage.

You can create, update and delete objects in the website, while also viewing orders, user information, and delivery locations. It is an essential tool to manage menu items, monitor orders, and identify trends.

It's important to note the admin panel features only enough functionality for the management of the site. You cannot for example, change a user's information or delete orders (though you can change their status to being cancelled).

# Future Enhancements:

Haya-ben is far from a finished product. Key features like adding items to cart, editing user profiles and viewing order history, adding all documentation and contact information in a footer element are still in development. There are also many styling and functionality features that are only half completed. 

Once the website is in full form we plan to implement the following featuers:

1. Email verification - For added security and spam accounts

2. Point-of-Sales System - A separate application that allows employees who are not admins to track and manage orders

3. Payment System - Having the user directed to a secure page to input their details and redirected after processing the order
